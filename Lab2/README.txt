Lab purpose: put keypad numbers into registers and registers will show the input when update bottom is clicked while update bottom would not clear other registers. When store switched to 1, the ALU input 1 and 2 will get assigned registers to left rotate the input1 by input 2 spaces.

How to run:
1. click clear, all registers will be preset to 0
2. select input on keypad.
3. select target registers on write address.
4. click updates then the target register would show the keypad input
5. switch read address 1 for alu input1 read address 2 for input 2
6. 1 for number be rotate, 2 for how many spaces to rotate
7. switch store to 1
8. the ALU output would show the number result that input1 after left shifted by “input2” bits.
