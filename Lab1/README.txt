Files in Lab1: Lab1.lgi
How to run the file:
1. open Multimedia Logic (MML)
2. open file Lab1.lgi
3. click run on the up left hand side. 
4. click different input to see does the LED on the output side turn on. 

The result should be :
for first output: different input should lead to different LED lights response. 
for second output: input 2 and 3 are not related to the output of the second one. only in 1 and 0 can affect the output.
for third output: all three output should turn on or off at the same time.
